    | Laravel's queue API supports an assortment of back-ends via a single
    | API, giving you convenient access to each back-end using the same
    | syntax for each one. Here you may set the default queue driver.
    |
    | Supported: "sync", "database", "null"
    | 
    | NOTICE: the 'sync' driver can be used on development environment,
    | but the recommended driver for production environment is 'database'.
    | Other back-ends such as beanstalkd are supported by Laravel, but have
    | not been tested under OpenDataBio development.
